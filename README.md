# Promise

Implementation of simple **Promise** that contains one method **then(onFulfilled, onRejected)**.

Examples of applying in **/example** folder.
**node example/%name%** to run example

**yarn test** to run tests

**PromiseLog** has the same functionality as **Promise** and logs steps to see how algorythm works.
